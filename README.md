# Extensions

I keep semi-useful pieces of js code here, hehe

## Quick access

Paste the following lines of code to use the particular extension(same as what is given in the folder of the extension)

- video playback:

  ```js
  document.write(
    `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jujhaar2409/extensions/master/videoplayback/videoplayback.js"></script>`,
  );
  ```
